# Workspace

### **Ergonomic Setup**

* **Chair**: Use a chair with back support. Add a lumbar cushion if needed.
* **Desk height**: Forearms parallel to the ground, elbows at \~90°.
* **Monitor height**: Top of the screen at eye level, \~20–30" from your eyes.
* **Keyboard & mouse**: Keep wrists neutral. Consider an external keyboard if using a laptop.

### **Lighting**

* Use **natural light** where possible, positioned *in front of* or *next to* you.
* Add a **warm desk lamp** for late hours—avoid harsh overhead lighting.
* Reduce screen glare and eye strain with **blue light filters** or apps like f.lux.


### **Minimize Distractions**

* Use **noise-canceling headphones** or a white noise machine.
* Set up **“Do Not Disturb” hours** and communicate them.
* Keep snacks, water, and tools nearby to avoid wandering.

### **Keep It Tidy**

* A clutter-free space = less mental overload.
* Do a 5-minute desk reset at the end of the day.
* Use cable organizers or a docking station to reduce mess.
