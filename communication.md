# Communication

## Clarity 

* Be specific by providing context and using more precise words and phrases.
    * Bad example: "How's progress on that task we talked about on Friday?"
    * Good example: "Regarding the process documentation for the ticketing workflow, does it still look like you'll be able to meet the deadline for Friday?"
* Without voice or body language, messages can be misread. To make the tone of your messages more friendly, you can use kind phrases help soften written words.
    * Bad example: "I don’t understand."
    * Good example: "I might be missing something—could you explain what you're aiming for here?"

* Double-check before you hit send to avoid submitting typos or messages that are difficult to read.
    * Bad example: "I"ll send teh report tomorrow. Its nearly done."
    * Good example: "I'll send the report tomorrow. It's nearly done."
